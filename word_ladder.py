Leetcode: Word Ladder
Given two words (start and end), and a dictionary, find the length of shortest transformation sequence from start to end, such that:
Only one letter can be changed at a time
Each intermediate word must exist in the dictionary
For example,
Given:
    start = "hit"
    end = "cog"
    dict = ["hot","dot","dog","lot","log"]
As one shortest transformation is "hit" -> "hot" -> "dot" -> "dog" -> "cog",
Return: its length 5.
Note:
    Return 0 if there is no such transformation sequence.
    All words have the same length.
    All words contain only lowercase alphabetic characters.
